## AUTOCONF SYSTEM ##

 - change option "name" for "essid"

 - ESSID should depends on channel

 - after removing /qmp_configured and having changed driver
   to madwifi autoconf scripts system ignores that.
   In fact the decision wheter it loads madwifi or mac80211
   depends on whether the qmp/network option mesh_devices
   has wlan* or ath* names in the list

-  felix patches must be checked:
   https://dev.openwrt.org/log/branches/backfire?rev=27441 and here:
   https://dev.openwrt.org/log/branches/backfire/package/mac80211/files/lib/wifi
   currently the patch instructions in the HOWTO fail!!!!!!


-  Make sure firewall is really disabled !!!!!!!!!! ARGHHH!!!!!


DONE:

-  The vlan problem with mac80211 drivers:
   vlan interfaces for ath9k are created as vlan12@wlan1
   NO vlan interfaces for ath5k devices are created.




Off the record:

## PAU ##
 - this is off the record...

## AGUSTI ##
-  Configuration eth0 in ipv4. Change 192.168.1.1 by default?
